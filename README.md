You can enable/disable different aspects for each experience:
```typescript
expandedFeatures: {
  showArchitecture: boolean;  // Show technical architecture details
  showMetrics: boolean;       // Show impact metrics
  showDiagrams: boolean;      // Show architecture diagrams
}
```

### Example Configuration:
```typescript
{
  title: "Software Engineer",
  company: "Example Corp",
  // ... basic info ...
  expandedFeatures: {
    showArchitecture: true,   // Enable architecture section
    showMetrics: true,        // Enable metrics section
    showDiagrams: false       // Disable diagrams
  },
  expanded: {
    // ... detailed content ...
  }
}
```

This allows you to:
- Show only relevant information for each experience
- Keep simpler experiences concise
- Highlight complex projects with full details
